This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made by following the [Introduction to React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

In addition to completing the project, I added the following suggested features:
* Display the location of each move
* Highlight the currently selected item in the move list
* Use two loops to write the Board component
* Add a button to toggle the order of the items in the move list
* Highlight the squares when a player wins

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
